# lil' git

A baby implementation of `git`, from scratch.

---

Made primarily for learning purposes, specifically:
- a deeper understanding of `git` as a whole (eg, a sense of "near sketetal completeness")
- a deeper understanding of how to potentially architecture a complex CLI application
- mental preparation for the `reprotemplates` project
